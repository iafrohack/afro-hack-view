> Frontend for the iAfroHack web app project.

## Build Setup

This app uses yarn for dependency management. @see https://yarnpkg.com/en/ for more info.

If you want to play around, feel free to clone it and just run the couple of commands below:

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run start

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
